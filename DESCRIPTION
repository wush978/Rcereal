Description: To facilitate using 'cereal' with R via 'cpp11' or 'Rcpp'. 'cereal'
    is a header-only C++11 serialization library. 'cereal' takes arbitrary data
    types and reversibly turns them into different representations, such as
    compact binary encodings, 'XML', or 'JSON'. 'cereal' was designed to be
    fast, light-weight, and easy to extend - it has no external dependencies and
    can be easily bundled with other code or used standalone. Please see
    <https://uscilab.github.io/cereal/> for more information.
